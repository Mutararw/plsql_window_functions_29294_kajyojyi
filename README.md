# SQL JOINs & Window Functions Project

## 1. Business Problem

### Business Context
This project is based on a regional retail business that sells products to customers located in different regions. The business maintains data about customers, products, and sales transactions.

### Data Challenge
Although sales data is recorded daily, management lacks clear analytical insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends over time.

### Expected Outcome
Use SQL JOINs and Window Functions to generate analytical reports that support better business and decision-making processes.

## 2. Success Criteria

1. Identify top-selling products using ranking window functions  
2. Calculate cumulative sales using aggregate window functions  
3. Analyze sales changes between periods using navigation functions  
4. Segment customers into revenue-based groups  
5. Analyze average sales trends over time

## 3. Database Schema Design

### Customers
- customer_id (PK)
- name
- region

### Products
- product_id (PK)
- name
- category
- price

### Sales
- sales_id (PK)
- customer_id (FK)
- product_id (FK)
- sales_date
- quantity
- amount

## 5. Part A — SQL JOINs

### INNER JOIN
```sql
SELECT c.name, p.name, s.amount
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
```

[INNER JOIN](public/inner_join.png)

---

### LEFT JOIN
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE s.sales_id IS NULL;
```

[left JOIN](public/left_join.png)

---

### RIGHT JOIN
```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.name
FROM sales s
RIGHT JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.sales_id IS NULL;
```

[right JOIN](public/right_join.png)

---

### FULL OUTER JOIN
```sql
SELECT c.name, s.sales_id
FROM customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN sales s
ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id;
```

---

### SELF JOIN
```sql
SELECT a.name, b.name, a.region
FROM customers a
JOIN customers b
ON a.region = b.region
AND a.customer_id <> b.customer_id;
```

## 6. Part B — Window Functions

### Ranking Function
```sql
SELECT p.name,
       SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s.amount) DESC) AS rank
FROM sales s
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.name;
```

---

### Aggregate Function
```sql
SELECT sales_date,
       amount,
       SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date) AS running_total
FROM sales;
```

[aggregate function](public/aggregate_function.png)

---

### Navigation Function
```sql
SELECT sales_date,
       amount,
       amount - LAG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date) AS difference
FROM sales;
```

[navigation function](public/navigation_function.png)

---

### Distribution Function
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS quartile
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

## 7. Results Analysis

### Descriptive
Sales performance varies across customers and products.

### Diagnostic
High revenue is generated by a small number of customers and products.

### Prescriptive
Focus on customer retention and product performance improvements.
